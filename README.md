- Asymptotic Notations

	- What is an asymptotic notations?
	- Why we use an asymptotic notations?

	- Types of Asymptotic Notations:

		- Big-Oh Notation(O) -> Upper Bound - Maximum Time
		- Big-Omega Notation() -> Lower Bound - Minimum Time
		- Big-Theta Notation() -> Average Bound/Time - Tight Bound

- Analysis of an Algorithms - Techniques

	- Time Complexity
	- Space Complexity
		- Space Complexity of an algorithms can be analysed by using any of the following methods:
			- Recurrence Tree Method - If the problem is small
			- Recursion Stack Method - If the problem is large 

	- Input -> Order of growth of running time complexity of an algorithms w.r.t input - Main factor to analyse an algorithms

	- Key-Points

		- Every single or simple statement of an algorithm takes 1 unit of time.
		- The time complexity of an algorithm is most commonly expressed using the Big-Oh notation.

- Best, Worst and Average case analysis:
	
	- Notations are used to describe the functions - gives an approximation value.
	- Cases are used for analysing an algorithms.

- Frequency Count Method - to analyse a simple Iterative programs.

- Problem Solving Techniques

	- Recursion - Recurrence Relation

		- Introduction to Recursion

		- Principle of Mathematical Induction - Heart of a Recursion - PMI

		- Methods for solving Recurrence Relations - Techniques

			- Substitution Method - Induction Method
				- Guess the solution
				- Use the mathematical induction to find the boundary condition and shows that the guess is correct.

			- Recurrence Tree Method
				- Draw a recurrence tree.
				- Calculate the time taken by every level of the tree.
				- Finally, Sum the workdone at all the levels.

			- Iteration Method
				- Expands the recurrence and express it as a summation of terms of n and initial condition.

			- Master Theorem
				- For Decreasing Functions
				- For Dividing Functions

		- Problems on Recursion:
			- Factorial Number
